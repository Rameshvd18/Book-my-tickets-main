# Book-my-tickets
Book My Tickets is a React.js web application that allows users to browse and book tickets for movies and sports events. It features a clean user interface, dynamic routing, and seamless CRUD operations powered by JSON Server. Users can view event details, fill out a booking form, and manage their bookings efficiently.

npm install react-slick --save  
npm install json-server  
npm install react-toastify  
npm install uuid  
npm install axios
